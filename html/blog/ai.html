                <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Artificial intelligence can be defined as a subset of computer science that is focused on building 
                    computer systems that have human level intelligence so that machines can perform tasks that require 
                    human level intelligence. These tasks may range from everyday things such as communicating with 
                    humans as chatbots or reading texts to more specialised procedures such as coming up with mathematical 
                    proofs or designing and building software.</p>
                <p>There are a multitude of different types of AI, but we can classify them in two main categories:<ul>
                    <li><b>General AI</b> – General AI has human level general intelligence and the ability to learn and would 
                        act in a way that is indistinguishable from normal humans. Unlike specialised AI, general AI can solve 
                        any problem and multiple different tasks at the same time. For example, it would be able to hold a 
                        conversation while also being able to process what its cameras are seeing.</li>
                    <li><b>Specialised AI</b> - Specialised AI is built to carry out one specific task, but to do it very 
                        well and can only perform under a narrow range of parameters and context. This means that when 
                        this type of AI faces a problem that it wasn’t specifically designed to solve, it is unable to 
                        solve it and fails. Some common examples include self-driving cars, Siri, email spam filters and 
                        facial recognition software.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">History</h3>
                <p>The idea of AI started in the 1950s with Alan Turing. Turing reasoned that humans use available information 
                    as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so he questioned the ability of machines 
                    to do something similar. He proposed a “seed AI” (kind of like a stupid baby AI) that would be able to learn 
                    from its experiences and “grow up” into a general AI. However, he was unable to get started on AI because 
                    computers were extremely expensive to run and buy (IBM 650 that was developed mid-1950s cost the equivalent 
                    of $4 million today).</p>
                <p>Since the 1950s, there have been multiple waves of AI funding and “AI winters” where funding receded. The first 
                    wave of funding came in 1956 when the first AI program, Logic Theorist, was presented at the Dartmouth Summer 
                    Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. This program was designed to perform automated reasoning and 
                    eventually proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in Principia Mathematica while also finding new and more elegant 
                    proofs for some.</p>
                <p>From 1957 to 1974, AI flourished since computers had been rapidly improving every year due to Moore’s Law 
                    (the exponential growth of transistors on a microchip) which meant that you could run more computationally 
                    intensive machine learning algorithms and already existing ones would run in shorter time. However, once the research 
                    into AI had started they realised that they had reached a massive obstacle. Even though computers were becoming more 
                    powerful they were still too slow and lacked sufficient memory to do anything substantial. This led to 
                    the first “AI winter”.</p>
                <p> In the 1980s, AI was reignited by the popularization of expert systems. The theory was that the program 
                    would ask an expert on how they would respond to a given situation and store their answer. The program would 
                    do this for every situation and eventually be able to give advice to a non-expert on how to respond. This was 
                    big jump in the 1980s and Japan invested 400 million dollars into revolutionising computer processing, implementing 
                    logic programming, and improving expert systems. Sadly, they failed to meet their goals and another AI winter began.</p>
                <p>In the 1990s, AI started to flourish again since the internet brought with it large amounts of data to 
                    train machine learning algorithms on as well as hardware improvements. The largest breakthrough for deep 
                    learning (a subset of machine learning) was using GPU’s highly parallel processing power to analyse and scan 
                    through large datasets quickly which shortened the time to train deep learning models significantly. Currently, we are 
                    in the middle of high investment in AI due to the large breakthroughs in the field of machine learning in the last decade. 
                    We now have specialised AI that can perform tasks better than or as good as a human would be able to do. Some of these tasks 
                    are handwriting recognition, natural speech recognition and playing games such as Chess or Go.</p>
                <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Future</h3>
                <p>Going forward we should expect more exciting breakthroughs, especially since general AI hasn’t really taken off yet so there is 
                    a lot of potential there. The exciting part comes after we finally construct a human level general intelligence. Why? Well a 
                    human level AI is not limited by biological conditions. Unlike biological beings, machines can evolve rapidly by simply improving 
                    their hardware and their source code which means a human level AI can recursively improve its own cognitive ability by improving 
                    its code and by becoming smarter the AI can improve its code even more. Another thing that machines aren't limited by is necessities. 
                    Biological beings need water, food, shelter, mates etc whereas an AI would need none of those things, it would operate on a 
                    much longer time scale than humans and would only be concerned about ensuring that it has enough resources to run its program. 
                    Last but not least, an AI is not limited by the speed of its neurons firing. Electricity travels at the speed of light which is 
                    much faster than our nerve impulses. This means that the AI can do many more computations than we can in a given second which 
                    allows it to progress a lot quicker than humans. After improving itself to a certain degree, the human level general intelligence 
                    will become a superintelligence.</p>
                <p>The pros of a superintelligence are immense. One pro may be that a superintelligence would be able to colonize space, for 
                    example by using Von Neumann probes (probes which can self-replicate in space) to mine other planets or asteroids. Another 
                    advantage is that humans may also live on Mars if the superintelligence succeeds in terraforming Mars. Furthermore, by improving 
                    our medical knowledge, techniques and drugs humans will be able to increase the average life expectancy and maybe even be 
                    able to upload their consciousness into VR. These are just a few of the many benefits superintelligence could bring.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if the superintelligence is handled incorrectly it may lead to an existential catastrophe. A few examples 
                    would be if a person with misguided motives obtained the superintelligence they could effectively take over the world or if 
                    someone assigns the superintelligence a task and while completing the task the superintelligence decides eliminating humans 
                    would help it complete its task. There is no way to predict what it would do since its cognitive ability would be beyond our 
                    comprehension. This leads to the control problem; how can we get the AI to do what we want it to do? Two possible solutions are:
                    <ul><li><b>Offload the control problem to the superintelligence</b> - Rather than specifying what we want the superintelligence 
                        to do we should instead tell the superintelligence to do what we would want it to do. Of course, it isn’t as simple as that as 
                        the superintelligence may misinterpret what we would like it to do. In Eliezer Yudkowsky’s paper Coherent Extrapolated Volition 
                        (CEV), he tells us that CEV means people's choices and the actions people would collectively take if "we knew more, thought faster, 
                        were more the people we wished we were, and had grown up closer together." This means that the superintelligence would do what 
                        majority of people would want it to do even if they don’t know it at the time. This stops it from misinterpreting since it isn’t 
                        what one person would want but rather what many different types of people would want.</li>
                    <li><b>Stunt the superintelligence’s potential</b> - There are multiple ways to do this, for example the superintelligence may only 
                        reply YES/NO to questions we ask or may be in a location where it is completely blocked off to the outside world. The risk here is 
                        that since we are facing a superintelligence it is very likely that it would eventually find a way to break out (for example 
                        emotionally manipulating the operator into letting him out) and this means we need a longer-term solution</li></ul></p>
                <p>To use superintelligence correctly, solving the control problem is vital.</p>
                <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Closing remarks</h3>
                <p>We are in a very exciting age for AI where we have breakthroughs in specialised AI every year while we edge closer and closer 
                    to general AI. Eventually, by using a superintelligence humans’ prosperity will boom as the superintelligence solves each 
                    problem, such as climate change, poverty and starvation, that troubles us. Of course, the viability of superintelligence 
                    application in our daily lives comes down to the control problem and whether a solution is found in time or not.</p>
