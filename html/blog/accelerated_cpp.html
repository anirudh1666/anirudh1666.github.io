            <h2>Accelerated C++ by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo</h2>

                <p>
                    Wanting to learn a more technically advanced language, I decided to learn C++.
                    I had some experience doing programming in C and had heard that C++ is a superset of
                    C so I had thought it wouldn't be too different. However, once I had started I found 
                    some of the concepts past the basics weren't easy to learn and so I turned to Accelerated
                    C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accelerated C++ goes through the fundamentals of C++ quickly and moves on to more advanced
                    topics such as the standard library, building your own data structures and managing memory 
                    effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One example of a technique taught to me was to use handle classes to manage memory
                    rather than explicitly managing pointers which was error prone. Building a handle class also 
                    helped me learn more about the lower level workings of classes such as destructors or member
                    operators (can't have overridden member operators in Java). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I learnt about template programming (which is basically writing generic functions) 
                    and how the C++ compiler performs various optimizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The book also has exercises questions and a lot of detailed examples to help you understand better
                    how C++ works. One example I found quite useful was a Student Record program that the reader
                    builds up as they work through the book. This example highlights all the key lessons taught in the
                    book such as containers, standard library, managing memory and iterators. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I feel as thought the book could've talked more about headers and building large multi-file
                    projects as when I was building my own basic Inventory program I struggled with circular dependency 
                    and linking all the files together. In addition, Accelerated C++ could've shown more examples as
                    detailed as the Student Record. After working on the same Student Record for a while, it feels
                    overused and boring.
