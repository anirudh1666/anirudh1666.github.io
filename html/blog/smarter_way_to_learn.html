                    For one of my projects and for the making of this website I needed to 
                    learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I wasn’t sure of which resources to use 
                    to learn these languages, but eventually I settled on using A Smarter 
                    Way to Learn JavaScript and A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS. In 
                    this article I will talk about my opinion about these books and if I 
                    would recommend them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both books take a unique approach to learning a new language by 
                    providing a means of testing yourself. Each book provides a link to
                    a website that was made by the author, Mark Myers, that has a set of 
                    questions. At the end of each chapter you can test yourself on the information 
                    you’ve read in that chapter. This method of teaching is works quite well as being 
                    tested forced me to recall what I learnt and hands on typing it in as answers helped me 
                    retain the information. In addition, there are 20 questions supplied per chapter 
                    and both books have 89 chapters. This means that there are in total 1780 questions 
                    per book. This is an enormous amount of practice and it improved the pace at which I learnt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, each of the chapters are quite small and focused so even if 
                    you don’t wish to learn all of it or want to focus on a specific part, you 
                    can easily skip ahead to the chapter you want. I’ve used it as a reference 
                    book for when I do programming in HTML, CSS and JavaScript I can quickly lookup 
                    whatever I am having trouble with and get a quick solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the book also teaches good software programming practices and neat ways of 
                    formatting code so that is readable for other people. It also teaches about DOM 
                    (Document Object Model) so you gain a basic understanding of how websites and browsers work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I would recommend these books for beginners who are looking to get into web development 
                    or programming in general. Some of the content at the beginning may be too easy for experienced programmers however it quickly goes into depth about the fundamentals of each language.
