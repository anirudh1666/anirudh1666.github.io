        <div id="content">
            <p>During my Object Oriented Programming modules one of the exercises was to build a solar system viewer 
                program in Java. Things related to space are quite intriguing and so I began building my own solar system viewer.
            </p>
            <p>The main problem I faced was that I had no experience with animations and drawing in Java and so I first found out as much as 
                I could about libraries like Javax, JavaSwing and JFrame. After learning the basics of each of them I started my project. 
            </p>
            <p>To help make the project managable I broke it down into 3 bits:
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly, I worked on building a completely black canvas with just the sun drawn in the center.</li>
                    <li>Secondly, I added planets and focused on coding circular motion to allow the planets to be seen rotating.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, I tried to make it as accurate as I could. However, I faced a problem at this step. When I tried to make both 
                        size and distance from the sun accurate, I found that since my screen was too small the Sun would swallow up the first couple of
                        planets or they would be too small and too close to the Sun. Instead by making the Sun smaller and keeping the planets sizes, distances 
                        and orbital speeds accurate I could fit them all onto my screen. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
