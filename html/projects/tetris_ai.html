            <h2>Tetris AI</h2>
            <p>11/2019</p>

        <div id="content">
            <p>As part of my Design and Professional skills module, I was assigned to build an AI that can 
                play Tetris without any help from the user. This was a challenge for me as I had just started programming 
                and had no experience with any AI or Machine learning algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>The hardest part was getting started. I had no clue what to do. After pondering for some time, I decided on a simple 
                yet effective approach. My approach is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>1) My AI would first clone the current board and try out a move in the cloned board.</li>
                    <li>2) The AI would score the cloned board using heuristics that I would assign before running the AI.</li>
                    <li>3) Repeat steps 1 - 2 for all possible moves and cloning the board each time.</li>
                    <li>4) Once all moves have been executed, take the lowest scoring move (lowest score = best board) and execute it on the real board.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>While I was implementing the algorithm above, I came across another major problem. I didn't have any idea on what the 
                heuristics should be and how they would tie together to give the final score. The heuristics I decided to use were aggregate height 
                (combined height of blocks in each column), holes and bumpiness (difference in heights of successive columns). Now the problem is assigning 
                weights to each heuristic. 
            </p>
            <p>I tried the most time consuming approach first, I used trial and error with different values to try and maximise the time my AI could play. 
                After a lot of wasted hours, I decided to use a more mathematical approach. Realising that holes become more and more important as you get more of them 
                I decided to use holes squared. This meant when you have a low amount of holes, they don't really impact the final score but as you get to higher numbers 
                they quickly become the dominating factor in the score. Aggregate height and bumpiness were linear functions so they grew at a constant rate. 
                For aggregate height I used aggregate height * 100 and for bumpiness I used bumpiness * 47.
            </p>
            <p>The equation for the score was = holes^2 + bumpiness*47 + aggregate_height*100.</p>
            <p>In hindsight, if I could redo this project I would use a genetic algorithm rather than trial and error to generate the weightings. In addition, I would structure 
                my code better and make it so that my AI would score moves that are 2 moves ahead rather than just the next move. This would allow the AI to predict the best scoring board 
                up to 2 moves away and allow it to run longer.
