            <h2>Maze Generator</h2>
            <p>06/2020</p>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p>Due to Coronavirus, my first year at university was cut short. The extra time allowed me to do 
                some of my own projects, one of which was a maze generator that ran in your browser. The original idea
                was to build a maze game where the user could control the sprite and move it in the maze. On completing 
                the maze, a new harder maze would be generated and the user would be allowed to solve that. I wanted to 
                build this app with a frontend and backend but I was unable to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>While planning this, I wanted to improve my web programming skills and become better at linking a frontend with a 
                backend. I planned to use JSPs and servlets since I had experience using them in one of my courseworks. However,
                while I was linking my backend to frontend, I found JSPs to be unneccessarily difficult and was unable to succesfully
                link a backend coded in Java and frontend in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This led to me coding the maze generating algorithm
                all in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Prior to this project, I had no JavaScript experience and had very little experience with HTML and CSS. This led to me going
                through the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology/dp/1497408180/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+javascript&qid=1592392447&s=instant-video&sr=8-1">
                A Smarter Way to learn JavaScript</a> and also <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Way-Learn-HTML-CSS/dp/150867387X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+html&qid=1592392494&sr=8-1">
                Smarter Way to learn HTML and CSS</a> both by Mark Myers. 
                You can read my review of both books in my blog. 
            </p>
            <p>Once I knew the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I divided the project into 3 subproblems which were:
                <ol>
                    <li>Generating a random Maze</li>
                    <li>Rendering and displaying maze to user</li>
                    <li>Connecting backend to frontend.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>I practiced solving problem 1 by implementing a depth first search algorithm in Java. 
                The algorithm I used was a recursive depth first search. You can see just this algorithm implemented
                in Java <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Exercises/Maze_Generator">here.</a> This algorithm 
                is slightly different from the traditional depth first search as
                it uses a stack rather than recursion. The advantage is that it allows deep recursion without
                worrying about a stack overflow error. The steps are outlined below:
                <ol>
                    <li>Push starting cell onto stack and mark it as visited.</li>
                    <li>Pop off the stack. Pick an unvisited neighbour of the popped cell. Push the neighbour cell
                        and popped cell onto stack and mark neighbour as visited. </li>
                    <li>Repeat step 2 until you reach a cell that has all its neighbours visited.</li>
                    <li>Pop off the stack and check if cell has any unvisited neighbours. Do this until you reach a
                        cell that has unvisited neighbours. Go to step 2.</li>
                    <li>Continue this algorithm until the stack is empty.</li>
                </ol>
                You can increase the difficulty by increasing the number of cells in the maze. The main disadvantage of this 
                algorithm is that it leads to long corridors and has a low branching factor.
            </p>
            <p>Solving problem 2 consisted of tinkering with a website I built with a maze that my algorithm already generated. I had to
                manually input this maze into JavaScript and drew it by hand so I knew what it should look like. I used JavaScript to draw
                on the canvas and the rest of it was in HTML. I used lineTo() and stroke() to draw the maze paths.
            </p>
            <p>This was the toughest problem as I started doing it the wrong way. I used JSPs rather than JSFs (didn't know about JSFs beforehand). 
                I had built a .csv file loader using JSPs in one of my courseworks so I had assumed it could be used to pass an arraylist of cells to 
                a JavaScript frontend. However, after many failed attempts I realised that JSPs weren't very convenient to use and stopped. Perhaps in 
                future I will come back and redo this project with a frontend and backend once I'm more experienced in web development.   
            </p>
            <p>In the future, I want to improve this project so that the user can control a sprite to solve the maze. Link to this project is <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/JavaScript/tree/master/Projects/maze_generator">here</a></p>
