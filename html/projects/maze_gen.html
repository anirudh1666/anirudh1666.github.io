            <h2>Maze Game</h2>

            <p>Due to Coronavirus, my first year at university was cut short. The extra time allowed me to do 
                some of my own projects, one of which was a maze game that ran in your browser. I wanted to 
                build this app with a frontend and backend but I was unable to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>While planning this, I wanted to improve my web programming skills and become better at linking a frontend with a 
                backend. I planned to use JSPs and servlets since I had experience using them in one of my coursework's. However,
                while I was linking my backend to frontend, I found JSPs to be unnecessarily difficult and was unable to successfully
                link a backend coded in Java and frontend in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This led to me coding the maze ggenerating algorithm as well 
                as player movement in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Prior to this project, I had no JavaScript experience and had very little experience with HTML and CSS. This led to me going
                through the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology/dp/1497408180/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+javascript&qid=1592392447&s=instant-video&sr=8-1">
                A Smarter Way to learn JavaScript</a> and also <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Way-Learn-HTML-CSS/dp/150867387X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+html&qid=1592392494&sr=8-1">
                Smarter Way to learn HTML and CSS</a> both by Mark Myers. 
                You can read my review of both books in my blog. 
            </p>
            <p>Once I knew the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I divided the project into 3 subproblems which were:
                <ol>
                    <li>Generating a random Maze</li>
                    <li>Rendering and displaying maze to user</li>
                    <li>Controlling player movement.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>I practiced solving problem 1 by implementing a depth first search algorithm in Java. 
                The algorithm I used was a recursive depth first search. You can see just this algorithm implemented
                in Java <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Exercises/Maze_Generator">here.</a> This algorithm 
                is slightly different from the traditional depth first search as
                it uses a stack rather than recursion. The advantage is that it allows deep recursion without
                worrying about a stack overflow error. The steps are outlined below:
                <ol>
                    <li>Push starting cell onto stack and mark it as visited.</li>
                    <li>Pop off the stack. Pick an unvisited neighbour of the popped cell. Push the neighbour cell
                        and popped cell onto stack and mark neighbour as visited. </li>
                    <li>Repeat step 2 until you reach a cell that has all its neighbours visited.</li>
                    <li>Pop off the stack and check if cell has any unvisited neighbours. Do this until you reach a
                        cell that has unvisited neighbours. Go to step 2.</li>
                    <li>Continue this algorithm until the stack is empty.</li>
                </ol>
                You can increase the difficulty by increasing the number of cells in the maze. The main disadvantage of this 
                algorithm is that it leads to long corridors and has a low branching factor.
            </p>
            <p>Solving problem 2 consisted of tinkering with a website I built with a maze that my algorithm already generated. I had to
                manually input this maze into JavaScript and drew it by hand so I knew what it should look like. I used JavaScript to draw
                on the canvas and the rest of it was in HTML. I used lineTo() and stroke() to draw the maze paths.
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, to solve problem 3 I modelled the player as a point on a 2D grid. The coordinates of the player correspond to a cell in the maze. 
               To check if the movement is allowed I would check if any of the neighbouring cells have an edge to the cell the player is currently on. In my first attempt
               to draw player movement I made the mistake of drawing the player on the same canvas. This meant erasing the player would erase part of the maze as well. To get around 
               this problem I layered another canvas ontop of the one containing the maze and would draw player movement on the top canvas. This allowed to me to redraw the player
               without worrying about modifying the maze.
