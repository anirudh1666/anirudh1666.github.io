            <h2>CSV file opener and reader</h2>

        <div id="content">
            <p>Two of my courseworks for Object Oriented programming module were to build a .csv file 
                opener and reader. The difference between these courseworks was that one was a desktop app and 
                the other was a browser application. 
            </p>
            <p>I started off with the desktop application. The first thing I needed to do was to build a data structure 
                that would be able to hold the data being read in from the .csv file. The data structure I decided to use was a 
                DataFrame that was made up of Columns objects. Each column object represented a field in the .csv file. 
            </p>
            <p>The next thing I worked on was designing the GUI. I used JFrame and JTable and ended up with a simple GUI that provided 
                all the necessary features. By making it simple, I was able to reduce the amount of bugs I would encounter when extending features.
                Once the GUI was complete, entering the data into the columns was quite easy. 
            </p>

            <p>The next coursework was to build a similar .csv but as a web application. The backend would be coded in Java and would handle managing the data. The 
                frontend would be coded in HTML5 and CSS3. I used servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP's) to allow the backend and frontend communicate. This was also the 
                first time I had coded in HTML and CSS3 so I was only able to make a basic web page to display the .csv file contents.</p>
