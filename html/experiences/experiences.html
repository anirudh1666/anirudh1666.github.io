                                <li><b>Communcation</b>: Tutoring has helped me a lot in communicating complex concepts to other people. 
                                I can now structure my speech in a way that is easy to grasp and is a lot more clearer.</li>
                                <li><b>Organisation</b>: Since GCSE's cover a lot of material, I had to organise and plan out our lessons beforehand 
                                so that we could cover the right topics in the right order. This helped me develop my organisational skills while also 
                                allowing me to think ahead.</li>

                            <li><b>Teamwork</b>: The hackathon was one and a half days long and was done in teams of 4. Throughout the day, our team worked 
                            together in cohesion towards building a carbon footprint desktop app.</li>
                            <li><b>Leadership</b>: I was the team leader so I responsible for assign each member a role that they were suited for. The next task was to 
                            divide up the workload fairly and assign teammates to the workloads. Using a Trello board helped here since it allowed us to communicate effectively 
                            while also holding regular meetings to keep up to speed with everyones progress. </li>

                    <p class="work-p">My responsibilites included having a class of kids from ages 9-12
                        anywhere from once to three times a week. I would be responsible for all the kids and
                        would be required to teach them for an hour about a different science topic each week.

                            <li><b>Communication</b>: Teaching young kids complex ideas helped me articulate my speech so that
                                it would be simple to understand.</li>
                            <li><b>Leadership</b>: I was responsible for over 20 kids in some classes so a lot of focus was
                                required to make sure no kids hurt themselves, made a mess or went missing. </li>
                            <li><b>Organisation</b>: Each week would have a different lesson plan so I would need to read over 
                                topics in advance to make sure I understand it and can present the topic clearly. We would
                                also do experiments which also required preplanning and setting up.</li>

                    <p class="date">07/2020</p>
                    <p class="work-p">Worked with Poplar HARCA in solving problems related to volunteering. During the tough times of covid 19, volunteering 
                        is hard to do so HARCA needed help coming up with ideas to help people volunteer online. Additionally, they needed help drafting a 
                        CSR document and coming up with a new template for their newsletter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-p">Skills gained:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Teamwork</b>: We worked in groups of 5 on our tasks. To help us communicate and work effectively we designated roles 
                            within the team, for example we had a person to write down questions we have, another person to write down ideas and another person 
                            to help draft documents.</li>
                            <li><b>Creativity</b>: We had to come up with creative roles for volunteers that could be done virtually while considering all the different 
                            factors that would affect it. For example, one idea we had was to do regular kahoot quizzes but a factor they would have to take into consideration is that 
                            not everyone may have access to laptops. To try and mitigate this we would use mentimeter which is more mobile friendly (since everyone has mobile phones). </li>
                            <li><b>Marketing</b>: Had to research ways that HARCA could improve their newsletter and reach their target audience better. Our group completely revamped it and I worked 
                            together with another person to build the template. The new newsletter is alot more concise and uncluttered while delivering key information.</li>

                    <p class="date">2020</p>
                    <p class="work-p">Completed a model project that professionals at KPMG would be expected to complete. My project was 
                        based around a small bicycle selling company in Australia who wanted to improve their sales by knowing which customers 
                        to target. My project duties included first assessing the data quality of a large dataset in accordance with a data quality framework table. 
                        The next task was to complete data analysis, model development and integration. Here I would analyse the data to look for patterns
                        and correlations and come up with hypothesis to explain the pattern. An example of a pattern I had noticed is that a large majority of customers were women
                        between the ages of 40-45. This could be explained by the fact children under 16 are unable to buy bicycles themselves and, therefore, 
                        asked their parents to buy them the bicycle. The last stage was data presentation. This stage I was tasked to display the important statistics 
                        using multiple dashboards.

                    <p class="date">2018</p>
                    <p class="work-p">Undertook a 4 day long workshop in Nuclear Engineering at Leeds University. During this time I learnt a lot about
                        Nuclear Engineering and the nuclear industry in general. One of our projects was to work together and see how Rolls-Royce submarines are designed
                        and how they can have nuclear reactors on board. In particular, our group focused on Small Modular Reactors (SMR's) which are in essence small nuclear
                        reactors that can be fit onto submarines. We also met professionals from Rolls-Royce who told us about the future of Nuclear Engineering and what working
                        in industry is like.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-p">Skills gained:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Teamwork</b>: Worked in teams throughout the entire workshop. Our teams main focus was Small Modular Reactors and two of our projects included making a 
                                presentation and giving it infront of faculty, professionals and other students and looking at different parts of submarines and what tools and techniques 
                                engineers use to make them suited for their tasks. For example, we saw ways of cooling a SMR on board a submarine by seeing a small scale demonstration.</li>
                            <li><b>Communication</b>: Being in a group with a lot of different people who came from different places meant I had to be able to communicate effectively with them. 
                                Good communication with other members led to our team working efficiently and progressing quickly on our projects.</li>
                            <li><b>Leadership</b>: I was the project leader of a presentation on Small Modular
                                Reactors (SMR's). As group leader, I organised and assigned roles to the rest of the team and
                                implemented techniques to help our team run smoothly and efficiently. One of the techniques I used
                                was to use Slack as a team message board to help us communicate with each other easily and
                                organise meetings to discuss the presentation.</li>
