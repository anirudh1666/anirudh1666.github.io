                    <p class="date">2020-Now</p>
                    <p class="work-p">My responsibilites included having a class of kids from ages 9-12
                        anywhere from once to three times a week. I would be responsible for all the kids and
                        would be required to teach them for an hour about a different science topic each week.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Communication: Teaching young kids complex ideas helped me articulate my speech so that
                                it would be simple to understand.
                            </li>
                            <li>Leadership: I was responsible for over 20 kids in some classes so a lot of focus was
                                required to make sure no kids hurt themselves, made a mess or went missing. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Organisation: Each week would have a different lesson plan so I would need to read over 
                                topics in advance to make sure I understand it and can present the topic clearly. We would
                                also do experiments which also required preplanning and setting up.

                    <p class="date">2018</p>
                    <p class="work-p">Undertook a 3 day taster course in Chemical Engineering at UCL. During this time
                        we have multiple projects to help us get a feel for Chemical Engineering and Engineering in general.
                        For example, on the last day we were assigned groups and told to build a car out of legos and various other
                        materials that would be powered by a chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-p">Skills gained:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teamwork: Throughout the course we were in groups which forced us to work together and communicate
                                effectively. I oversaw designing the car and my contribution helped to make the car more
                                streamlined and prevent it from breaking down mid race. Another one of my contributions to make
                                our project more efficient was to use a production line so that we can make different models quickly and test them to see which worked best.
                            </li>
                            <li>Communication: Additonally, during the course we had to do a presentation on our car that was powered
                                by a chemical reaction. This assignment improved my communication skills as I was one of the people who had a 
                                larger amount of content to present and had to explain our car design in terms of aerodynamics in a manner that would
                                be easy to understand.
                            </li>

                    <h3 class="title">Rolls-Royce Nuclear Engineering Summer Workshop at Leeds University</h3>
                    <p class="date">2018</p>
                    <p class="work-p">Undertook a 4 day long workshop in Nuclear Engineering at Leeds University. During this time I learnt a lot about
                        Nuclear Engineering and the nuclear industry in general. One of our projects was to work together and see how Rolls-Royce submarines are designed
                        and how they can have nuclear reactors on board. In particular, our group focused on Small Modular Reactors (SMR's) which are in essence small nuclear
                        reactors that can be fit onto submarines. We also met professionals from Rolls-Royce who told us about the future of Nuclear Engineering and what working
                        in industry is like.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-p">Skills gained:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teamwork: Worked in teams throughout the entire workshop. Our teams main focus was Small Modular Reactors and two of our projects included making a 
                                presentation and giving it infront of faculty, professionals and other students and looking at different parts of submarines and what tools and techniques 
                                engineers use to make them suited for their tasks. For example, we saw ways of cooling a SMR on board a submarine by seeing a small scale demonstration.
                            </li>
                            <li>Communication: Being in a group with a lot of different people who came from different places meant I had to be able to communicate effectively with them. 
                                Good communication with other members led to our team working efficiently and progressing quickly on our projects.
                            </li>
                            <li>Leadership: I was the project leader of a presentation on Small Modular
                                Reactors (SMR's). As group leader, I organised and assigned roles to the rest of the team and
                                implemented techniques to help our team run smoothly and efficiently. One of the techniques I used
                                was to use Slack as a team message board to help us communicate with each other easily and
                                organise meetings to discuss the presentation.</li>
