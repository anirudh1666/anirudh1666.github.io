                    <li>
                        <b>Object Oriented Programming: </b> Programmed in Java and gained an understanding of 
                        object oriented programming design practices. Learnt the basics of various software engineering
                        design practices such as Model View Controller. During this module I had 3 courseworks to complete. The 
                        first one was to complete a MySet data structure that was built using factory design practice with various
                        member functions, you can view <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Courseworks/CW/COMP0004MySetBasic">here.</a> The second coursework was to build a desktop app that would
                        be able to load a csv file and display it to user. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Courseworks/CW/javaCW2">here.</a> The last coursework was to build a web application using HTML/CSS and
                        Java. Using JSPS and servlets we communicate between the frontend and backend. You can see this project <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Courseworks/CW/JavaCW3">here.</a>

                    <li>
                        <b>Algorithms: </b> Introduced some basic well known algorithms for searching and sorting. Learnt
                        how to analyse them and deduce the time-complexity. Moved onto some graph theory algorithms such as Bellman
                        -Ford and Dijkstra's as well as some others. Gained a basic understand of compression algorithms as well. One of
                        our courseworks was to use a Stereo-Matching algorithm from a research paper and implement it. You can see this algorithm
                        <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Python/blob/master/Exercises/stereo_matching.py">here.</a>

                        <b>Mathematics for Computer Scientists: </b> Module was split into two main parts. A discrete maths part and a linear 
                        algebra part. During the discrete part we learnt about set theory, different types of functions, basics of counting, 
                        permutations, group theory (lagrange theorem), modular arthimetic and how RSA encryption works. In linear algebra we learnt
                        about matrix multiplication and determinants.

                    <li>
                        <b>Theory of Computation: </b> Introduction to formal logic and different forms of
                        logic such as First-Order logic and Modal Logic. Learnt about different methods of mathematical
                        proofs such as induction, strong induction, infinite descent etc. In second half we learnt about
                        different types of languages such as regular languages and context-free languages. Additionally, we
                        learnt about automata and how to various methods of constructing them. Examples of automata we learnt
                        about include finite-state, push-down and turing machines.

                    <li>
                        <b>Compilers: </b> We went through the stages a high level programming language goes through before it can be executed by 
                        the computer. For the frontend we first went over various forms of languages (context-free, regular etc) and automata. Then we 
                        learnt about parsers and lexers and built our own for a made up programming language called Z-Lam. You can view this CW 
                        <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Compilers/tree/master/CW/project/src">here.</a> Once we learnt about lexical, syntax and semantic analysis we went through code generation and learnt about
                        various optimization techniques a compiler uses to make the code more efficient.

                    <li>
                        <b>Engineering Challenges:</b> This module was divided into two parts. Part 1 consisted of building a single cycle processor on an 
                            FPGA and programming it to count to infinity or square to infinity. We learnt about the basics of CPU architecture by building 
                            various chips such as carry lookahead adder, ALU etc. You can find the chip circuits and a presentation showcasing our CPU <a href=
                            "">here.</a> The second part consisted of working with engineers from other departments to build and program a bioreactor that could ferment yeast. 
                            The bioreactor is a model for a large scale device that would be built to manufacture TB vaccines on a large scale so we also had to consider the social, 
                            economic and political factors. We worked closely with electrical engineers in building the circuits and programming the MSP board that controlled the reactor.

                        <b>Principles of Programming: </b> Programmed in C and Haskell. Learnt
                        about the basics of programming and good programming practices. Coursework included
                        building an Inventory program in C and MySet data structure with functions on MySet in 
                        Haskell. <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Haskell/blob/master/My_Set_CW.hs">Haskell CW</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/C/blob/master/Coursework.c">C CW.</a>

                        <b>Design and Professional skills: </b> In this module we gained an understanding of the various parts of Computer Science. We undertook different piece of small courseworks relating to 
                            various parts in Computer Science. Some of the stuff we did included learning the basics of debugging by debugging code given to us, basics of machine learning by building a 
                           AI that can play Tetris (view <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Python/tree/master/Projects/Tetris_AI_CW">here</a>) and designing an internet protocol for a multiplayer online pacman game to help us learn about networking.
