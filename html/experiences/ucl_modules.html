                    <li>
                        <b>Object Oriented Programming: </b> Programmed in Java and gained an understanding of 
                        object oriented programming design practices. Learnt the basics of various software engineering
                        design practices such as Model View Controller. During this module I had 3 courseworks to complete. The 
                        first one was to complete a MySet data structure that was built using factory design practice with various
                        member functions, you can view <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Courseworks/CW/COMP0004MySetBasic">here.</a> The second coursework was to build a desktop app that would
                        be able to load a csv file and display it to user. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Courseworks/CW/javaCW2">here.</a> The last coursework was to build a web application using HTML/CSS and
                        Java. Using JSPS and servlets we communicate between the frontend and backend. You can see this project <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Java/tree/master/Courseworks/CW/JavaCW3">here.</a>

                    <li>
                        <b>Algorithms: </b> Introduced some basic well known algorithms for searching and sorting. Learnt
                        how to analyse them and deduce the time-complexity. Moved onto some graph theory algorithms such as Bellman
                        -Ford and Dijkstra's as well as some others. Gained a basic understand of compression algorithms as well. One of
                        our courseworks was to use a Stereo-Matching algorithm from a research paper and implement it. You can see this algorithm
                        <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Python/blob/master/Exercises/stereo_matching.py">here.</a>

                    <li>
                        <b>Theory of Computation: </b> Introduction to formal logic and different forms of
                        logic such as First-Order logic and Modal Logic. Learnt about different methods of mathematical
                        proofs such as induction, strong induction, infinite descent etc. In second half we learnt about
                        different types of languages such as regular languages and context-free languages. Additionally, we
                        learnt about automata and how to various methods of constructing them. Examples of automata we learnt
                        about include finite-state, push-down and turing machines.

                        about the basics of programming and good programming practices. Coursework included
                        building an Inventory program in C and MySet data structure with functions on MySet in 
                        Haskell. <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Haskell/blob/master/My_Set_CW.hs">Haskell CW</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/C/blob/master/Coursework.c">C CW.</a>
